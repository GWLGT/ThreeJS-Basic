## Three JS Basics

This project cover up basic stuff in Three.js
like Shadow, Light, Basic geometry, Standard Material etc

### To avoid Copyright thing, I didn't include The three.min.js, Orbit Controls and Dat.gui,
#### Follow this step:

1. Go to [threejs.org](https://threejs.org)
2. Download three.js-master.zip
3. Un-zip the file
4. Find the required file (`three.min.js, OrbitControls.js, lil-gui.module.min.js`)
5. Copy/Cut the `three.min.js` file to `Three.js-Basic/libs`
6. Copy/Cut the `OrbitControls.js` file to `Three.js-Basic/libs/jsm/controls`
7. Copy/Cut the `lil-gui.module.min.js` file to `Three.js-Basic/libs/jsm/libs`
7. Finally, open the `index.html` in your Browser

### Happy Coding!
